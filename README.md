# Youth-in-internet-policy (YiIPO)

Hello! Mhoro! Unjani! Eita! 

Welcome to my community initiative on youth in internet policy in Southern Africa! üèÜ‚úçüèΩüìöüòÅ

# Vision
I am working on building a community of young people in the Southern African region to collaborate and contribute to internet policy processes in the sub-region. I aim to work with early career and mid-level career youth in related areas of work; those who have been part of internet governance programs; those interested in technology and human rights; and youth in the technical community. I aim to build a community for young people to be representative of the stakeholders they come from and raise their concerns to be taken into consideration for policy development.  I want to work openly so as to facilitate a collaborative space, that everyone may contribute to in their own capacity, which may also be replicated in different regions and everyone has a sense of ownership and responsibility over the project.

# What's Unique about this
The idea is unique in that it aims to build a network for young people from diverse backgrounds to support each other contributing to internet policies ‚Äì creating a space where they lead and shape the policy engagement.

# My OL7 Culture Story
Curiosity often leads to discovery of new opportunities. I first discovered the OL program, through a friend on her presentation day as she prepared for her case study. She mentioned to me that perhaps this might be useful for an idea that I, together with three other colleagues had started working on building a community for emerging leaders in internet governance. While the idea had been fantastic, we faced issues in delivery and a challenge in time and resources as well as best guidance. Therefore, the opportunity to be mentored and build a community on values of openness and collaboration appealed to me in order to learn open leadership.
When I first joined the program, my expectations were really on learning how to build a community of people interested in policy, that would be sustainable and reflective of the needs of young people. Having taken the open leadership assessment, it was confirmed that what I needed to do was focusing on build for participation and inclusion and building for understanding

I set out the following goals:
‚Ä¢	Reaching out and being open to engagement by the wider community on the project
‚Ä¢	Identifying and working with people from different backgrounds who will add value to the project
‚Ä¢	Find ways of collaboration with other key players
‚Ä¢	Have a meet-up with people interested in the project


# How you can contribute
I would like for people to sign up who might be interested in having a virtual meet up and be connected to other initiatives working with young people in the policy space

# Wishlist
Resource wise I would need suggestion of an open platform that‚Äôs great for a  virtual meet up, young people with experience on engaging in policy and can be mentors for the program and support peer learning in policy processes.

# About me
My interest in the ICT sector developed from learning about mobile for development while writing my master‚Äôs thesis on women and use of mobile phones in the informal sector in 2014. I have since focused on issues of ICT access and use and related digital policy developments in Africa. I have worked extensively in the African region. I have participated in internet governance capacity building programs such as the African School of Internet Governance as a fellow and now faculty as well as the ICANN fellowship program. I am currently a researcher and communications and evaluations manager tasked with overseeing research to policy communications at Research ICT Africa. My areas of interest include understanding meaningful internet access and use, building capacity for participation in internet policy processes and the social impact of emerging technologies with a particular focus on the youth and gender aspect.
