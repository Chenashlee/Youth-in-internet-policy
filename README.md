# Youth-in-internet-policy
Hello! Mhoro! Unjani! Eita! 

Welcome to my community initiative on youth in internet policy in Southern Africa! üèÜ‚úçüèΩüìöüòÅ

# Vision
I am working on building a community of young people in the Southern African region to collaborate and contribute to internet policy processes in the sub-region. I aim to work with early career and mid-level career youth in related areas of work; those who have been part of internet governance programs; those interested in technology and human rights; and youth in the technical community. I aim to build a community for young people to be representative of the stakeholders they come from and raise their concerns to be taken into consideration for policy development.  I want to work openly so as to facilitate a collaborative space, that everyone may contribute to in their own capacity, which may also be replicated in different regions and everyone has a sense of ownership and responsibility over the project.

# What's Unique about this
The idea is unique in that it aims to build a network for young people from diverse backgrounds to support each other contributing to internet policies ‚Äì creating a space where they lead and shape the policy engagement.

# How you can coprogramntribute
I would like for people to sign up who might be interested in having a virtual meet up and be connected to other initiatives working with young people in the policy space

# Wishlist
Resource wise I would need suggestion of an open platform that‚Äôs great for a  virtual meet up, young people with experience on engaging in policy and can be mentors for the program and support peer learning in policy processes.

# About me
My interest in the ICT sector developed from learning about mobile for development while writing my master‚Äôs thesis on women and use of mobile phones in the informal sector in 2014. I have since focused on issues of ICT access and use and related digital policy developments in Africa. I have worked extensively in the African region. I have participated in internet governance capacity building programs such as the African School of Internet Governance as a fellow and now faculty as well as the ICANN fellowship program. I am currently a researcher and communications and evaluations manager tasked with overseeing research to policy communications at Research ICT Africa. My areas of interest include understanding meaningful internet access and use, building capacity for participation in internet policy processes and the social impact of emerging technologies with a particular focus on the youth and gender aspect.
