# Youth-in-internet-policy
Hello! Mhoro! Unjani! Eita! 

Welcome to my community initiative on youth in internet policy in Southern Africa! 🏆✍🏽📚😁

# My vision
I am working on building a community of young people in the Southern African region to collaborate and contribute to internet policy processes in the sub-region. I aim to work with early career and mid-level career youth in related areas of work; those who have been part of internet governance programs; those interested in technology and human rights; and youth in the technical community. I aim to build a community for young people to be representative of the stakeholders they come from and raise their concerns to be taken into consideration for policy development.  I want to work openly so as to facilitate a collaborative space, that everyone may contribute to in their own capacity, which may also be replicated in different regions and everyone has a sense of ownership and responsibility over the project.

# What's Unique about this
The idea is unique in that it aims to build a network for young people from diverse backgrounds to support each other contributing to internet policies – creating a space where they lead and shape the policy engagement.

# How you can contribute
I would like for people to sign up who might be interested in having a virtual meet up and be connected to other initiatives working with young people in the policy space

# Wishlist
Resource wise I would need suggestion of an open platform that’s great for a  virtual meet up, people with expertise on engaging in policy and mentors for the program.
